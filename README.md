# MastersProject
Work completed based upon my masters project on radio interferometry.

In this file you will find model sersic light profiles. I have validated by own sersic profile function against that of Astropy.

The sersic profiles have been created for the galaxy M31 and adapted for hypothetical galaxies of light radius twise and four times M31. This illistrates the behavour of a sersic profile.
Furhtering this manipulation multiple sersic indexs have also been plot with fixed radius showing how the light curve chnages for such senarios.
It can be seen there is a degeneracy between the two as it is hard to see the difference between more compact dim objects and more diffuse bright objects. 

As well as sersic light profiles there are examples of the use of fourier trasnform (fft) on a gaucian with different values of sigma. This illistraes the behavour of a fourior transform. Leading to using the fft for a sersic profile of M31 and a fictional galaxy twise M31's size
